The dataset is collected at Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine
We have collected a new open-source dataset called IST-C, retrospectively from patients admitted to the Radiology department of Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine 
from March 2020 to August 2020.

The collected dataset consists of 336 chest CT scans from COVID-19 infected patients, along with 245 scans showing normal lung parenchyma and 131 scans from Non-COVID-19 pneumonia, tumors and emphysema patients. 

The collected CT scans in DICOM format consists of 16-bit gray scale images of size 512x512. Each scan is accompanied with a set of personal attributes, such as patient ID, 
age, gender, location, date, etc. The average age of the patients is 52 +/- 17 years, in which 405 of the patients are male and 274 patients are female. 

The annotation of this dataset is at CT scan level: the CT of a patient as a whole is labelled as COVID-19, ''Normal'', or ''Other'' by expert radiologists at 
Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine.
